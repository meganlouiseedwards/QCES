        "\n",
        "A critical aspect of understanding climate and environmental systems is describing the movement of substances. This could include pollution or water vapor in the atmosphere, salt in an estuary, or chemicals in a river. We often model the transport of these substances using an advection/diffusion equation for the concentration of the substance. In this context, we sometimes refer to the concentration field as a `tracer' since it helps us track the movement of individual molecules. We can also use this framework to describe the transport of heat, although in this case the tracer field (temperature or heat content) tracks the movement of thermal energy.\n",

        "Munk (1966) proposed that the thermal structure of the ocean interior is set by a balance between upwelling and diffusion. In this view, cold waters sink near the poles and spread across the seafloor before slowly rising through the ocean interior. If we assume, as Munk did, that the water upwells uniformly across the globe, the upwelling speed is approximately $10^{-7}$ m/s. This is far too small to directly measure, but it is large enough to have a major impact on the distribution of tracers. Since light can only penetrate through the top ~100m of ocean, we can ignore solar heating, except in that it sets the temperature near the ocean surface."

        "\n",
        "Decades of research to measure the turbulent diffusivity in the ocean consistently found values much smaller than the one predicted by Munk (1966). Specifically, while larger values of the turbulent diffusivity were found near the bottom of the ocean over rough topographic features, the values in the upper ocean were about 10x smaller than the values predicted by Munk. 50 years after Munk's seminal paper, Ferrari et al. (2016) proposed that a depth-dependent turbulent diffusivity could be balanced by <em>downwelling</em>, with negative vertical velocities in the ocean interior. In this theory, the overturning circulation is upwelling in thin boundary layers along the sloping sides of the ocean basins.\n",

The combination of differential advection by the currents and cross-stream diffusion is very effective at mixing the plume in the x-direction. This is an example of Taylor dispersion (Taylor, 1953). Construct numerical experiments to quantify Taylor dispersion and its dependence on the current shear and the diffusivity. You could also separate the diffusivity into parts in the x and y directions with different coefficients.  If you set the x-component of the diffusivity to zero, then any spreading of the concentration in the x-direction should be due to Taylor dispersion.\n",

For example, you could make the river speed decrease exponentially in time, or it could be sinusoidal in time.\n",
